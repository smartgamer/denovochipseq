Note that the make process will build the .cgi files from the .pl files,
filtering them through sed scripts to add site specific configuation
information.

This means that you should edit only the .pl files NOT the .cgi files. You
can then use 'make' and 'make install' to generate the .cgi files and copy them to the proper location.
