              DUST is a program that analyzes DNA sequences for low
	      information content, and replaces those subsequences by
	      <i>N</i>s. Use DUST if you are producing motifs containing
	      repetitions that you suspect are not biologically
	      significant.
	      DUST is not applicable to protein sequences
	      and any settings in the web interface for DUST are
	      ignored for protein sequences. Input is a cutoff score
	      for ignoring subsequences. All subsequences <I>a</I> of
	      window size <i>W</i>=64 are scored for the number
	      repeated triplets (sequences of length three) they
	      contain. Allowed values: 1 to 50, default 20. Smaller
	      values ignore more subsequences.<BR>

	      PURGE removes redundant sequences from a FASTA file.  This is recommended
	      in order to prevent highly similar sequences distorting the search
	      for motifs. It can be run on DNA or protein
              sequences. The cutoff score (that you supply as input)
              used to remove similar sequences is based on the
              blosum62 relatedness score. Scores of up to 150 to 200
              are useful. Allowed values: 1 to 250, default
              100. Smaller values remove more sequences.<BR>

              <li><b>shuffle sequence letters</b><br />
              You can ask for the letters in each of your input sequences to be
              shuffled. This can be useful for determining if the motifs found
              using your (unshuffled) sequences are not statistically
              significant. To determine this, compare the <i>E</i>-value (or score) for
              the best motif/alignment from your original sequences with that
              using the "Shuffle sequence letters" option. (Keep all
              other parameter settings the same so that the comparison will be
              valid.) Compare the best <i>E</i>-value (or score) for the first motif in
              the original run to the best E-value (or score) for the first motif
              in the shuffled run. If they are similar (or the <i>E</i>-value (score) in
              the shuffled run tends to be better), then the motif is probably
              not significant. <br/>
              Repeat this process for each motif bearing in mind
              that the earlier motifs are most likely to be significant.
              Concluding that a motif is significant is more problematic. For
              MEME, low <i>p</i>-value occurrences of the motif in many sequences and in
              a conserved position relative to other motifs (or the ends of the
              sequence) is evidence that it is statistically significant. You can
              use the shuffle option to help determine what "low" is for the
              particular set of sequences and parameters you are using.
