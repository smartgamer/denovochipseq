              <h1>MEME Suite</h1>
              The MEME Suite web application requires the use of JavaScript
              <br />
              Javascript doesn't seem to be available on your browser.
            </noscript>
            MEME searches for similarities among the sequences you give
            it. How those similarities (motifs) may be shared is determined by
            the <b>motif distribution menu</b>.
            <ol>
            <li>One per sequence</li>
            <li>Zero or one per sequence</li>
            <li>Any number of repetitions</li>
            </ol>
            If you choose the first option, MEME assumes that each
            sequence in the dataset contains <b>exactly</b> one occurrence of
            each motif. This option is the <i>fastest</i> and most
            <i>sensitive</i> but the motifs returned by MEME may be "blurry" if
            any of the sequences is missing them.
            <p>If you choose the second option, MEME assumes that each sequence
            may contain <b>at most</b> one occurrence of each motif. This
            option is useful when you suspect that some motifs may be missing
            from some of the sequences. In that case, the motifs found will be
            more accurate than using the first option. This option takes more
            computer time than the first option (about twice as much) and is
            slightly less sensitive to weak motifs present in all of the
            sequences.</p>
            <p>If you choose the third option, MEME assumes each sequence may
            contain <b>any number</b> of non-overlapping occurrences of each
            motif. This option is useful when you suspect that motifs repeat
            multiple times within a single sequence. In that case, the motifs
            found will be much more accurate than using one of the other
            options. This option can also be used to discover repeats within a
            single sequence. This option takes the much more computer time than
            the first option (about ten times as much) and is somewhat less
            sensitive to weak motifs which do not repeat within a single
            sequence than the other two options.</p>
