                <b>A.</b> You should have received a
                confirmation email that your job is submitted.  If you
                haven't received this email, then you might have typed
                in the wrong email address.</p>

		Alternatively, your mail program may be filtering the

                <p> 
                <b>A.</b> Yes, the web interface to the job queue.
                can be accessed <a
                href="http://meme.nbcr.net/ganglia/addons/rocks/queue.php?user=meme&amp;sortby=id&amp;sortorder=up&amp;update=1">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p> In your confirmation email, you are given a MEME
                JOB ID, which is a randomly generated number for each
                job.  You may check the status of your job with the
                MEME JOB ID by looking at the job info given <a
                href="http://meme.nbcr.net/ganglia/addons/rocks/queue.php?user=meme&amp;sortby=id&amp;sortorder=up&amp;update=1">here.</a></p>
		<p>
		Currently the MEME JOB ID is indicated only for active
                jobs running on the clusters, and appears in the job
                name column as "meme.(MEME_JOB_ID).script".  The first
                column ("Id") is the batch job ID for the Sun Grid
                Engine, a batch scheduler.

                <b>Q.</b> Why don't the motif occurrences in the
                "Summary of Motifs" block diagrams match the
                occurrences shown in the individual motif block
                diagrams?
                <p> 
                <b>A.</b> The motif occurrences shown for a motif in
                its section of the output are the ones discovered by
                the MEME algorithm.  These occurrences are then used
                to create a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM)
                for the motif.  The PSSMs for all of the motifs
                discovered by MEME are then used to search for
                non-overlapping sets of occurrences of motifs with
                p-values under 0.0001 using the MAST algorithm.  These
                are displayed in the "Summary of Motifs" block
                diagram.  Individual motif occurrences will sometimes
                be missing from the "Summary of Motifs" block diagram
                because of the non-overlapping or minimum p-value
                requirements.  Conversely, there may be motif
                occurrences in the summary diagram that were not
                discovered by the MEME algorithm.

                <b>A.</b> The file must be a plain text file. MSWord
                files, for example, are not acceptable. MSWord files
                can be converted to plain text by: <br/>

                <b>Q.</b> Is it possible to introduce specific amino
                acid compositions in the MEME and MAST programs?
                <p> 
                <b>A.</b> MEME can use higher-order background models.
                However, doing this requires a locally installed MEME
                and running "fasta-get-markov", which is included in
                the distribution. The relevant switch to MEME is
                "-bfile".</p>
		<p>
                MAST can only use zero-order (compositional)
                models. This is done automatically on the web server
                when searching the "upstream" databases using a file
                based on all upstream regions for the particular
                organism.  As with MEME, users of locally installed
                MAST can specify their own background files. The
                switch to MAST is "-bfile".

                <b>Q.</b>
                I don't really understand what the pseudocount
                parameters for tomtom represent, nor how to use them
                properly.
                <p>
                <b>A.</b> Essentially, a pseudocount corresponds to a
                Bayesian prior.  If you flip a coin 10 times and
                observe 10 heads in a row, then without a prior, you
                would estimate the probability of observing a heads on
                the next round as 100%.  But because you have a prior
                belief that the coin is probably fair, you might
                pretend that you started off with one heads and one
                tails.  Then you would say that you've seen 1 tails
                and 11 heads, so your probability of heads would be
                91.7%.  If you keep flipping the coin all day, and you
                only ever see heads, then the estimated probability of
                heads would eventually get very close to 100%.</p>

                <p>
                The motif pseudocounts work they same way: they allow
                you to say that, even though we've never seen an "A"
                in position 3 of the motif, it's still a possibility.
                Pseudocounts are important for motifs with few known
                occurrences.  If you have a motif built from 100
                instances, then the pseudocount is not likely to be
                important, but if the motif is based on only a handful
                of instances, then it is.</p>

                <p>
                Motifs coming out of MEME already have pseudocounts
                included in them.  Otherwise, it's a good idea to add
                a small pseudocount.</p>

                <b>Q.</b>
                MEME Suite won't compile!
                I get error messages about <code>libxml2</code> or <code>libxslt</code>.
                What should I do?
                <p>
                <b>A.</b>
                <a href="http://xmlsoft.org"><code>libxml2</code></a> 
                is a library for parsing XML files.
                <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/"><code>libxslt</code></a> 
                is a library for processsing XML files.
                using XSLT stylesheets.
                MEME Suite will try to use the versions of these libraries
                already installed on your system. 
                If the libraries can't be found on your system, 
                MEME Suite will build its own copies from source included in the 
                MEME Suite distribution.
                If MEME Suite detects a local copy of <code>libxml2</code>, 
                but no local copy of <code>libxslt</code>, it will try to build
                its own copy of <code>libxslt</code>, but it may run into
                conflicts between the installed versions of <code>libxml2</code>
                and included version of <code>libxslt</code> that will keep MEME suite 
                from compiling.
                If you run into this problem you can force MEME Suite to build 
                both libraries from the included source.
                Just add the options <code>--enable-build-libxml2</code> and 
                <code>--enable-build-libxslt</code> to your <code>configure</code>
                command line.
                For further information about <code>configure</code> options see
                the <a href="doc/meme-install.html#customconfig">installation guide</a>.
