              <li><b>Discriminative Motif Discovery</b><br/>
	      An approach to motif discovery where you are attempting
	      to find a motif that is not only specific to sequences
	      of interest, but is <i>not</i> specific to other similar
	      sequences.<br>
	      <br>
	      An example is with finding a DNA
	      transcription factor binding site, where you may have
	      some sequences that are likely to contain binding sites,
	      and other sequences that are unlikely to contain binding
	      sites (perhaps all found in one experiment). In this
	      case, you want to use the likely
	      (&lsquo;positive&rsquo;) sequences to search for the
	      motif, while using the unlikely (&lsquo;negative&rsquo;)
	      sequences to guide the search away from motifs that are
	      not only specific to the positive but also the negative
	      sequences. The approach we use here is to calculate a
	      <a href="#psp">position-specific prior</a> that we use
	      as an additional input to MEME, to inform the search as to the
	      probability of a motif starting at any given starting
	      point in the positive sequences. The approach we use is
	      based on the <i>discriminative prior</i> devised by
	      Narlikar <i>et al</i>. We modify their approach to
	      search for the "best" initial motif width, and to handle
	      protein sequences, using <a href="#triples"><i>spaced
	      triples</i></a>.<br>
	      <br>
	      The principle behind a discriminative
	      prior arises from the question:
	      <blockquote>
		What fraction of all occurrences of the <i>w</i>-mer
		(subsequence <i>w</i> long) at that site are found in the
		positive set?
	      </blockquote>
	      We score each position by counting
	      how often the <i>w</i>-mer starting there occurs in the
	      positive set (call this count #<b>X</b>) and how often
	      it occurs in the negative set (this count is
	      #<b>Y</b>). The score for the location is then:<br>
		<div style="width:50px;float:left;"> &nbsp;
		</div>
		<div style="width:50px;float:left;" align=center>
		  #<b>X</b><br />
		  <hr>
		    #<b>X</b> + #<b>Y</b>
		</div>
		<br><br><br>
	      If we find any ambiguous letters in a <i>w</i>-mer
	      (e.g. <code>N</code>, which stands for any base in
	      DNA), we count any such <i>w</i>-mer as if it occurs once.
	      <br><br> 
	      For protein sequences, instead of requiring an exact
	      match of a <i>w</i>-wide subsequence, we break the
	      subsequence down into <i>spaced triples</i>, in which we
	      only care about the first and last letter, and one of
	      the interior letters. See below for a more detained
	      description of spaced triples.<br><br>
	      The actual formula we calculate includes pseudocounts so
	      that small numbers of occurrences in the positive set without
	      any occurrences in the negative set do not cause false
	      peaks in the PSP. Once we have calculated scores, we
	      scale them to lie between 0.1 and 0.9 inclusive. We
	      convert the scaled scores to probabilities to complete
	      the calculation of the PSP. As with DNA sequences, we
	      treat any triple containing an ambiguous symbol as if it
	      only occurs once.<br>
              <br>More detail follows.<br><hr>
	      <ul>

		<li><b>Position-Specific Priors</b><br/>
		  Position-specific priors (PSPs) assign a probability
		  that a motif starts at each possible location in
		  your sequence data. MEME uses PSPs to guide its
		  search, biasing the search towards sites that have
		  higher values in the PSP file. PSPs in general
		  assist MEME by increasing the probability of start
		  sites containing a subsequence that is commonly
		  found in sequences of interest, as well as taking
		  lowering the probability of start sites that are
		  characteristic of sequences that are unlikely to
		  contain the feature of interest. PSPs are calculated
		  here using a combination of the sequences you supply
		  to MEME (the <a href="#positiveset">positive</a>
		  set) and an
		  additional <a href="#negativeset">negative set</a>
		  of sequences.
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none"><a name= "negativeset"></a></li>
		<li><b>Negative Set</b><br/> The negative set is a
		  sequence file (in any of the
		  <a href="help_format.html">formats</a> allowed for
		  MEME input) containing sequences that are used to
		  help MEME discriminate a motif in the positive
		  set. The negative set should contain sequences that
		  are in some sense a contrast to likely sites for
		  motifs (e.g. sequences rejected as unlikely to
		  contain a transcription factor binding site), but
		  otherwise similar to the positive set.
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none"><a name= "positiveset"></a></li>
		<li><b>Positive Set</b><br/> The positive set is the
		  same sequences as you provide to MEME to search for
		  motifs. We call these sequences the positive set
		  when
		  doing <a href="#discriminative">discriminative</a>
		  motif finding, to contrast these sequences with
		  the <a href="#negativeset">negative</a> set.
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none"><a name= "triples"></a></li>
		<li><b>Spaced Triples</b><br/> Spaced triples are
		  sub-sequences in which only the first and last
		  letter (residue or amino acid for protein) and one
		  interior letter are used in matches. For example,
		  the subsequence<br>
		  <code>MTFEKI</code> contains the following
		  triples:<br>
		    <code>MT...I</code><br>
		    <code>M.F..I</code><br>
		    <code>M..E.I</code><br>
		    <code>M...KI</code><br>
		  where "." matches anything. We use spaced triples
		  for protein because the probability of exact matches
		  is much lower than for DNA, with the much larger
		  amino acid alphabet we use to represent protein
		  sequences. Any triple containing an ambiguous
		  letter is scored as zero.<br>
		  <br>
		  To score a subsequence <i>w</i> wide
		  using triples, we count how often each triple
		  contained in that subsequence occurs in the positive
		  and negative sets and use the maximum counts in the
		  same formula as we use for scoring a <i>w</i>-mer,
		  but with the counts now referring to the highest
		  count of triples in the current location, rather
		  than how many times the whole subsequence occurs:<br>
		<div style="width:50px;float:left;"> &nbsp;

		<div style="width:50px;float:left;" align=center>
		  #<b>X</b><br />
		  <hr>
		    #<b>X</b> + #<b>Y</b>
