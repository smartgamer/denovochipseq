              <h3>MEME -- Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation</h3>
              <h3><i>Motif discovery tool</i></h3>
              <hr />
              <!--<p><b>The input to MEME contains the following fields.</b></p>-->
              <ul>
              <li style="list-style: none"><a name="distribution"></a></li>
              <li><b>motif distribution</b><br />
              This is where you tell MEME how you believe occurrences of the
              motifs are <a href="help_distribution.html"><b>distributed</b></a>
              among the sequences. Selecting the correct type of distribution
              improves the sensitivity and quality of the motif search. <a name=
              "nmotifs"></a></li>
              <li><b>number of motifs</b><br />
              MEME will look for up to this number of distinct motifs in the
              training set. MEME will stop when this number of motifs has been
              found, or when none can be found with <i>E</i>-value less than
              10000. <a name="nsites"></a></li>
              <li><b>number of sites</b>[optional]<br />
              This is the total number of sites in the <i>training set</i> where
              a single motif occurs. You can choose different limits for the
              <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> number of occurrences that MEME
              will consider. If you have prior knowledge about the number of
              occurrences that motifs have in your training set, limiting MEME's
              search in this way can can increase the likelihood of MEME finding
              true motifs.<br />
              For example, if you know that each motif is likely to occur at
              least 5 times but no more than 8 times in the training set, you
              could specify:
              <div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Minimum</b> sites = 5<br />
              <b>Maximum</b> sites = 8</div>
              MEME will then only report motifs with between 5 and 8 occurrences,
              inclusive, in the training set. (The same range [5,...,8] will
              apply, separately, to each motif MEME finds.) MEME may still find
              motifs with slightly fewer or more occurrences then those you
              specify. In the above example, if there is a motif in the training
              set with only 4 occurrences, MEME may still find it, but it will
              report 5 occurrences, one of which will be erroneous. Likewise, if
              a motif in the training set has 9 occurrences, MEME will probably
              still find it, but it will report only 8 of its occurrences.<br />
              MEME chooses the number of occurrences to report for each motif by
              optimizing a statistical heuristic function, restricting the number
              of occurrences to the range you give here, or using defaults
              described below if you leave these fields blank.<br />
              <b>Note 1:</b><br />
              Leave these fields blank if you have selected "<b>One</b> per
              sequence" in the "How you think the occurrences... are
              <b>distributed</b>" field. In that case, each sequence must have
              exactly one occurrence of each motif. It also doesn't make any
              sense to set the maximum number of sites to a number larger than
              the number of sequences if you have chosen the "<b>Zero or one</b>
              per sequence distribution. In that case, there can never be more
              occurrences of a motif than there are sequences.<br />
              <b>Note 2:</b><br />
              These fields are optional. If you leave them blank, MEME will
              choose limits depending on the type of occurrence distribution you
              have specified and the number of sequences (<i>n</i>) in the
              training set. MEME will also override your settings if they
              conflict with the type of distribution you have chosen (see <b>Note
              1</b>, above).

              <a name="width"></a></li>
              <li><b>motif width</b><br />
              This is the width (number of characters in the sequence pattern) of
              a single motif. MEME chooses the optimal width of each motif
              individually using a statistical heuristic function. You can choose
              different limits for the <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> motif
              widths that MEME will consider. The width of each motif that MEME
              reports will lie within the limits you choose.  
              <a name="max_width"></a>
	      <br><b>Note on maximum width:</b> <br>
  	      Both protein and DNA motifs are often
              shorter than the default "maximum width" (50).
	      It is often advisable for you to reduce that parameter 
	      to a much smaller value (e.g., in the range 10--20) by 
              entering a new value in the box.
	      <a name= "bfile"></a></li>
              <li><b>use a different Markov background model</b><br />
              You can provide a Markov background model for MEME to use as its
              model of "random" sequences. The format and effect of the
              background model file is described under the topic "BACKGROUND
              MODEL" on the <a href="doc/meme.html">MEME "man page</a>".
              <br />
              The downloadable version of MEME contains a script named
              "fasta-get-markov" that you can use to create background model
              files in the correct format from FASTA sequence files. 
              <a name="posonly"></a></li>
              <li><b>search given strand only</b><br />
              MEME searches for motifs on both the given DNA strand <b>and</b>
              the reverse complement strand by default. Checking this box will
              cause MEME to search the given DNA strand only. <a name=
              "discriminiative"></a></li>
              <li><b>discriminative motif discovery</b><br />
              Providing <i>negative</i> sequences using this option results in creation of a
              <i>position-specific prior</i> (PSP), with the negative sequences and the main (<i>positive</i>)
              sequences as inputs to a PSP generator program, which is run as an
	      extra step before running MEME. The resulting 
              PSP file is used as an additional input to MEME. For more detail,
              see documentation on <a href="help_psp.html">discriminative motif discovery</a>.
              </li> <a name=
              "pal"></a></li>
              <li><b>look for palindromes only</b><br />
              Checking this box causes MEME to search only for DNA palindromes.
              This causes MEME to average the letter frequencies in corresponding
              motif columns together. For instance, if the width of the motif is
              10, columns 1 and 10, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, etc., are averaged
              together. The averaging combines the frequency of A in one column
              with T in the other, and the frequency of C in one column with G in
              the other. If this box is <b>not</b> checked, the columns are
              <b>not</b> averaged together.
