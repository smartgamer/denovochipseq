<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><b>Why can't the Meta-MEME program 'mhmm' read my MEME output
file?</b>
<p>Meta-MEME can only read the HTML version of MEME ouput.
Also, Meta-MEME cannot read MEME files that contain both
positive and negative motifs. If you don't know what this means,
don't worry about it. Only advanced MEME users are likely to
produce files containing positive and negative motifs. In the
future, Meta-MEME will be capable of processing these motifs.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why doesn't Meta-MEME include in the hidden Markov model all
of the motifs that I requested?</b>
<p>This is generally only a problem if you have downloaded the
Meta-MEME source code and installed it locally.</p>
<p>When building a linear HMM, Meta-MEME uses output from MEME to
set the order and spacing of motifs within the model. Meta-MEME
therefore requires that the MEME output provided to 'mhmm' contains
at least one motif occurence diagram that contains exactly one
occurence of each of the selected motifs. Occurences of motifs that
were not requested are ignored.</p>
<p>If, for example, you request that the model contain motifs 1, 2
and 3, but the MEME output file contains only these diagrams</p>
<pre>
   30-[1]-23-[3]-1
   28-[1]-32
   40-[2]-2-[3]-1
   2-[1]-[1]-4-[2]-[3]-3
</pre>
then 'mhmm' will be unable to find a representative diagram. The
program will then throw out the last requested motif and re-search
the diagrams, repeating this procedure until it finds a diagram
that works. In this case, there is no diagram containing motifs 1
and 2 either, so the final model would be based upon the first
diagram and would contain only motif 1.
</li>
<li><b>All of the scores from my Meta-MEME search are below zero.
What does this mean, and how do I fix it?</b>
<p>Occasionally, Meta-MEME has a tendency to improperly scale the
log-odds scores that it reports. This is a result of the mismatch
between the topology of the foreground and background models. The
problem is especially likely when Viterbi, rather than total
probability, log-odds scores are computed. You can try computing
total probability scores instead, or turn off the training portion
of Meta-MEME to create a model that is less finely-tuned to your
particular training set.</p>
