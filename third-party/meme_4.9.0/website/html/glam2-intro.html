            <h3>Overview</h3>

	    <h4>GLAM2 is a tool for discovering <em>gapped</em> motifs in a
	    group of DNA or protein sequences.</h4>  
	    <p>Equivalently, it is a
	    tool for aligning similar regions in a group of sequences.</p>

	    <p>It is harder to discover gapped motifs than gapless motifs: so when
	    you use GLAM2, we recommend that you also do a simpler gapless
	    analysis with MEME.</p>

	    <p>Here is a <a href="doc/examples/glam2_example_output_files/glam2.html">GLAM2 sample output</a>.  A
	    motif consists of aligned columns (coloured letters) and insertions
	    (grey letters).  The aligned columns may include deletions (black
	    dots).  GLAM2 does not try to align inserted (grey) letters with one
	    another: it assumes their identity is unimportant.</p>

	    <p>GLAM2 reports a score for each motif, higher scores indicating
	    stronger motifs.  It also reports a "marginal score" for each site,
	    stronger scores indicating better matches to the motif.</p>

	    <p>Unlike MEME, GLAM2 does not try to find several different motifs
	    all in one go.  Instead, it performs replicates: it tries to find the
	    best possible motif ten times.  The highest-scoring result is shown at
	    the top, with the other replicates below it.  You should check that at
	    least some of the replicates are similar to the top motif: if not,
	    click the button to re-run GLAM2 more slowly and thoroughly.</p>

	    <p>You can control the gapiness of GLAM2 motifs, using four
	    "pseudocount" options.  Their relative values control GLAM2's aversion
	    to gaps: increasing the no-deletion pseudocount relative to the
	    deletion pseudocount makes it more averse to deletions, and likewise
	    for the no-insertion and insertion pseudocounts. Their absolute values
	    control GLAM2's preference for putting gaps together in the same
	    positions: decreasing the deletion and no-deletion pseudocounts makes
	    it more prone to gather deletions into a few columns, and likewise for
	    the (no-)insertion pseudocounts.  The pseudocounts affect the score
	    calculation, so scores are not comparable between motifs found with
	    different pseudocounts.</p>

	    <p>If your sequences include repeats or extended regions of homology,
	    GLAM2 will gladly find them for you.</p>

	    <p>GLAM2 will always report the best motif it can find, even if you
	    give it random sequences.  So, to check that your motif is
	    significant, you may wish to run GLAM2 on control (e.g. shuffled)
	    sequences as well, and compare the motif scores.  The input form
	    includes a checkbox for shuffling the sequences.</p>
