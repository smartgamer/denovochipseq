            <h2><i>Motif search tool</i></h2>
            <hr />
            <h3><b>The input to MAST contains the following fields.</b></h3>
            <ul>
            <li style="list-style: none">
            <a name="motif-file"></a></li>
            <li><b>motifs</b><br />
            This is the name of a file on your computer that contains one
            or more of motifs that characterize a group of related sequences.
            This will normally be the name of a file that contains the results of a
            <a href="meme-intro.html"><b>MEME</b></a> analysis. If you wish to
            use motifs from another source it must be first converted to a 
            compatble <a href="doc/meme-format.html" >format</a>. A "browse" button is
            provided by MAST to help you locate the motif file you wish to use.
            <li><a name="strands"></a><b>treatment of reverse complement strands</b><br />
            MAST can automatically generate the reverse complement strand for
            each <b>nucleotide</b> sequence in the database and treat it in
            three different ways. ("Given strand" refers to the sequence as it
            appears in the database MAST is searching.):
            <ol>
            <li><b>combine with given strand</b><br />
            MAST searches for motif occurrences on either the given strand or
            its reverse complement <b>together</b>, not allowing occurrences on
            the two strands to overlap each other, and displays them together
            as a single sequence. This allows motifs to occur on either strand
            and still count toward the overall <i>E</i>-value of the
            match. (The given strand is the sequence as it appears in the
            database MAST is searching.)</li>
            <li><b>treat as separate sequence</b><br />
            MAST to search for motifs in both the given strand and its reverse
            complement, treating them as two, independent sequences. As of version
            4.3.2 the results are displayed together in the html though in previous
            versions the results were displayed separately for the two strands, as though
            both had occurred in the database.</li>
            <li><b>none</b><br />
            MAST searches only the given strand of each sequence in the
            database.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Note</b>: this field has no effect when the database contains
            protein sequences. <a name="use_seq_comp"></a></li>
            <li><b>use individual sequence composition in <i>E</i>-and
            <i>p</i>-value</b> calculation<br />
            This option can improve search selectivity when erroneous matches
            are due to <b>biased sequence composition</b>. MAST normally
            computes <i>E</i>-values and <i>p</i>-values using a random
            sequence model based on the <b>overall</b> letter composition of
            the <b>database</b> being searched. Selecting this option will
            cause MAST to use a <b>different</b> random model for <b>each
            target sequence</b>. The random model for each target sequence will
            be based on its letter composition, not that of the entire
            database. Using this option will tend to give more accurate
            <i>E</i>-values and increase the <i>E</i>-values of compositionally
            biased sequences. This option may <b>increase search times
            substantially</b> if used in conjunction with <a href=
            "#ev"><i>E</i>-value display thresholds</a> over 10, since MAST
            must compute a new set of motif score distributions for each
            high-scoring sequence. <a name="mev"></a></li>
            <li><b>ignore motifs with high <i>E</i>-values</b><br />
            MAST can ignore motifs in the query with <i>E</i>-values above a
            threshold you select. This is desirable because motifs with high
            <i>E</i>-values are unlikely to be biologically significant. The
            default threshold will cause MAST to use <b>all</b> motifs in the
            query, regardless of their <i>E</i>-values.<br />
            <b>Note:</b> This option is only available for motifs generated by
            MEME 3.0 and above. <a name="dna"></a></li>
            <li><b>search nucleotide database with protein motifs</b><br />
            Choosing this option will cause MAST to search the nucleotide
            version of the selected sequence database, converting the
            nucleotide sequences to protein sequences in all six reading
            frames. By default, MAST searches the protein version of the
            selected database when you give it a file of protein motifs.
            <a name="use_seq_p"></a></li>
            <li><b>scale motif display threshold by sequence length</b><br />
            MAST displays motifs that score above a threshold for all
            high-scoring sequences. By default, this threshold is based on the
            probability of the motifs without regard to the length of the
            sequence. The threshold was chosen with protein sequences of
            average length in mind. Consequently, many positions in very long
            sequences may match motifs with scores above this threshold by
            chance, making the results difficult to interpret. Selecting this
            option causes the motif display threshold to take sequence length
            into account. This will reduce the number of weak motifs displayed
            in long sequences and minimize the size of the output file.
            <a name="ev"></a></li>
            <li><b><i>E</i>-value display threshold</b><br />
            MAST only displays sequences matching your query with
            <i>E</i>-values below the given threshold you specify here. By
            default, sequences in the database with matches with
            <i>E</i>-values less than 10 are displayed. If your motifs are very
            short or have low information content (are not very specific), it
            may be impossible for any sequence to achieve a low <i>E</i>-value.
            If your MAST search returns no hits, you may wish to increase the
            <i>E</i>-value display threshold and repeat the search.</li>
