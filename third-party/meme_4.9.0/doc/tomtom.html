      <h3>Usage:</h3>
      <code>tomtom [options] &lt;query&nbsp;motifs&gt; 
        &lt;target&nbsp;motif&nbsp;database&gt;+</code>
    </div>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>The Tomtom program searches one or more query motifs against one or
      more databases of target motifs (and their DNA reverse complements), and
      reports for each query a list of target motifs, ranked by <i>p</i>-value.
      The <i>E</i>-value and the <i>q</i>-value of each match is also reported.
      The <i>q</i>-value is the minimal false discovery rate at which the
      observed similarity would be deemed significant.  The output contains
      results for each query, in the order that the queries appear in the input
      file.</p>

      <p>For a given pair of motifs, the program considers all offsets, while
      requiring a minimum number of overlapping positions. For a given offset,
      each overlapping position is scored using one of seven column similarity
      functions defined below. Columns in the query motif that don't overlap the
      target motif are assigned a score equal to the median score of the set of
      random matches to that column. In order to compute the scores, Tomtom
      needs to know the frequencies of the letters of the sequence alphabet in
      the database being searched (the "background" letter frequencies). By
      default, the background letter frequencies included in the MEME input
      files are used. The scores of columns that overlap for a given offset are
      summed. This summed score is then converted to a <i>p</i>-value. The
      reported <i>p</i>-value is the minimal <i>p</i>-value over all possible
      offsets.  To compensate for multiple testing, each reported <i>p</i>-value
      is converted to an <i>E</i>-value by multiplying it by twice the number of
      target motifs.  As a second type of multiple-testing correction, 
      <i>q</i>-values for each match are computed from the set of 
      <i>p</i>-values and reported.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <h4>Query Motifs</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>A file containing one or more motifs in <a href="meme-format.html"
        >MEME format</a>. Each of these motifs will be searched against the
        target databases. If you only wish to search with a subset of these
        motifs then look into the <span class="popt">-m</span> and
        <span class="popt">-mi</span> options.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Target Motif Databases</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>One or more files containing one or more motifs in
        <a href="meme-format.html">MEME format</a>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>Tomtom writes its output to files in a directory named
      <code>tomtom_out</code>, which it creates if necessary. (You can also
      cause the output to be written to a different directory; see
      <span class="popt">-o</span> and <span class="popt">-oc</span>, below.)</p>

      <p>The main output file is named <code>tomtom.html</code> and can be viewed 
      with a web browser. The <code>tomtom.html</code> file is created from the
      <code>tomtom.xml</code> file. An additional file, <code>tomtom.txt</code>,
      contains a simplified, text-only version of the output. (See
      <code>-text</code>, below, for the text output format.)</p>
      
      <p>For each query-target match, two additional files containing LOGO
      alignments may also be written -- an encapsulated postscript file
      (<code>.eps</code>) if the <span class="popt">-eps</span> flag is
      specified and a portable network graphic file (<code>.png</code>) if the
      <span class="popt">-png</span> flag is specified. An install of
      ghostscript is required to create the png file.</p>

      <p>Only matches for which the significance is less than or equal to the
      threshold set by the <span class="popt">-thresh</span> switch will be
      shown. By default, significance is measured by <i>q</i>-value of the
      match. The <i>q</i>-value is the estimated false discovery rate if the
      occurrence is accepted as significant. See Storey JD, Tibshirani R,
      "Statistical significance for genome-wide studies".
