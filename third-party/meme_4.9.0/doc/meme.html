      <p>
      MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in a group of related DNA or protein sequences.
      </p>
      <p>
      A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related
      protein or DNA sequences. MEME represents motifs as position-dependent
      letter-probability matrices which describe the probability of each possible
      letter at each position in the pattern. Individual MEME motifs do not 
      contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps are split by MEME into two 
      or more separate motifs.
      </p>
      <p>
      MEME takes as input a group of DNA or protein sequences (the training set)
      and outputs as many motifs as requested. MEME uses statistical modeling
      techniques to automatically choose the best width, number of occurrences,
      and description for each motif.
      </p>
      <p>
      MEME outputs its results primarily as a hypertext (HTML) document
      named <code>meme.html</code>.  This is placed in a directory named <code>meme_out/</code>".  
      You can select for the directory to have a different name.
      MEME also outputs machine-readable (XML) a plain-text versions
      of its output, named <code>meme.xml</code> and <code>meme.txt</code>, respectively.  These
      are placed in the same output directory as <code>meme.html</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The MEME results consist of:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      The version of MEME and the date it was released. 
      </li>
      <li>
      The reference to cite if you use MEME in your research. 
      </li>
      <li>
      A description of the sequences you submitted (the "training set")
      showing the name, "weight" and length of each sequence. 
      </li>
      <li>

      ran MEME. 
      </li>
      <li>

      <ol>
      <li>A summary line showing the width, number of occurrences, log
      likelihood ratio and statistical significance of the motif.</li>
      <li>A sequence "LOGO" illustrating the motif, along with links to 
      publication-ready versions of the LOGO (postscript and PNG formats).</li>
      <li>
      The occurrences of the motif sorted by <i>p</i>-value and aligned with each other. 
      </li>
      <li>
      Block diagrams of the occurrences of the motif within each sequence in the training set. 
      </li>
      <li>
      The motif in BLOCKS format: buttons for viewing the motif in various formats
      and for submitting it to the BLOCKS multiple alignment processor.
      </li>
      <li>
      A position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for use in scanning sequence databases
      and a button for submitting the motif to the MAST scanning program.
      </li>
      <li>
      The position specific probability matrix (PSPM) describing the motif
      and a button for comparing the motif to known motifs.
      </li>
      <li>
      A regular expression describing the motif.
      </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
      A summary of motifs showing an optimized (non-overlapping) tiling of
      all of the motifs onto each of the sequences in the training set. 
      </li>
      <li>
      The reason why MEME stopped and the name of the CPU on which it ran. 
      </li>
      <li>
      This explanation of how to interpret MEME results.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>
      <code>&lt;dataset&gt;</code> The name of the file containing the training set sequences.  
      If <code>&lt;dataset&gt;</code> is the word <code>stdin</code>, MEME reads from standard input.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The sequences in the dataset should be in Pearson/FASTA format.  For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
          &gt;ICYA_MANSE INSECTICYANIN A FORM (BLUE BILIPROTEIN)
          GDIFYPGYCPDVKPVNDFDLSAFAGAWHEIAK
          LPLENENQGKCTIAEYKYDGKKASVYNSFVSNGVKEYMEGDLEIAPDA
          &gt;LACB_BOVIN BETA-LACTOGLOBULIN PRECURSOR (BETA-LG) 
          MKCLLLALALTCGAQALIVTQTMKGLDI
          QKVAGTWYSLAMAASDISLLDAQSAPLRVYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQKW
      </pre>
      <p>
      Sequences start with a header line followed by
      sequence lines.  A header line has
      the character "<code>&gt;</code>" in position one, followed by
      an unique name without any spaces, followed by
      (optional) descriptive text.  After the header line 
      come the actual sequence lines.  Spaces and blank 
      lines are ignored.  Sequences may be in capital or 
      lowercase or both.  
      </p>
      <p>
      MEME uses the first word in the header line of each 
      sequence, truncated to 24 characters if necessary,
      as the name of the sequence. This name must be unique. 
      Sequences with duplicate names will be ignored. 
      (The first word in the title line is 
      everything following the "<code>&gt;</code>" up to the first blank.)
      </p>
      <p>
      Sequence weights may be specified in the dataset
      file by special header lines where the unique name
      is "<code>WEIGHTS</code>" (all caps) and the descriptive 
      text is a list of sequence weights. 
      Sequence weights are numbers in the range <code>0 &lt; w &lt;= 1</code>.
      All weights are assigned in order to the
      sequences in the file. If there are more sequences
      than weights, the remainder are given weight one.
      Weights must be greater than zero and less than
      or equal to one.  Weights may be specified by
      more than one "<code>WEIGHT</code>" entry which may appear
      anywhere in the file.  When weights are used, 
      sequences will contribute to motifs in proportion
      to their weights.  Here is an example for a file
      of three sequences where the first two sequences are 
      very similar and it is desired to down-weight them:
      </p>
      <pre>

      </pre>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h2>
      <p>
      MEME has a large number of optional inputs that can be used
      to fine-tune its behavior.  To make these easier to understand
      they are divided into the following categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      OUTPUT DESTINATION &#8212; control where MEME places its output
      </li>
      <li>
      ALPHABET &#8212; control the alphabet for the motifs (patterns) that MEME will search for
      </li>
      <li>
      DISTRIBUTION &#8212; control how MEME assumes the occurrences of the motifs are distributed 
      throughout the training set sequences
      </li>
      <li>
      SEARCH &#8212; control how MEME searches for motifs
      </li>
      <li>
      SYSTEM  &#8212; 
      the <code>-p &lt;np&gt;</code> argument causes a version of MEME compiled for a parallel CPU 
      architecture to be run.  
      (By placing <code>&lt;np&gt;</code> in quotes you may pass installation specific switches to
      the 'mpirun' command.  The number of processors to run on must be the first 
      argument following <code>-p</code>).
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      In what follows, <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> is an integer, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> 
      is a decimal number, and <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> is a string of characters.
      </p>

      <h3>OUTPUT DESTINATION</h3>
      <p>
      By default MEME writes its results to a directory named <code>meme_out/</code>,
      which is created if it doesn't exist.
      The main results include file is <code>meme.html</code>.
      You can specify that a different directory be created or used for results.
      You can also specify that MEME create only a text file.
      <ul>
      <li>
      <code>-o &lt;output dir&gt;</code> &#8212; Name of directory for output files;
      will <b>not</b> replace existing directory.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>-oc &lt;output dir&gt;</code> &#8212; Name of directory for output files;
      <b>will</b> replace existing directory.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>-text</code> &#8212; Output in text format only to standard output.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>ALPHABET</h3>
      <p>
      MEME accepts either DNA or protein sequences, but not both in the same run.
      By default, sequences are assumed to be protein.  The sequences must be in 
      FASTA format.
      </p>
      <p>
      DNA sequences must contain only the letters "<code>ACGT</code>", plus the ambiguous
      letters "<code>BDHKMNRSUVWY*-</code>". 
      Protein sequences must contain only the letters "<code>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY</code>",
      plus the ambiguous letters "<code>BUXZ*-</code>".
      </p>
      <p>
      MEME converts all ambiguous letters to "<code>X</code>", which is treated as "unknown".
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <code>-dna</code> &#8212; Assume sequences are DNA; default: protein sequences.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>-protein</code> &#8212; Assume sequences are protein.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="distribution">DISTRIBUTION</h3>
      <p>
      If you know how occurrences of motifs are distributed in the training set 
      sequences, you can specify it with the following optional switches.  The 
      default distribution of motif occurrences is assumed to be zero or one 
      occurrence of per sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you know how occurrences of motifs are distributed in the training set 
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <code>-mod &lt;string&gt;</code> &#8212; The type of distribution to assume.  
      <ul>
      <li>
      <code>oops</code> &#8212; One Occurrence Per Sequence MEME assumes that each sequence in the dataset
      contains exactly one occurrence of each motif.
      This option is the fastest and most sensitive but the motifs returned by MEME may be 
      "blurry" if any of the sequences is missing them.        
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>zoops</code> &#8212; Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence
      MEME assumes that each sequence may contain at
      most one occurrence of each motif. This option
      is useful when you suspect that some motifs
      may be missing from some of the sequences. In
      that case, the motifs found will be more
      accurate than using the first option. This
      option takes more computer time than the
      first option (about twice as much) and is
      slightly less sensitive to weak motifs present
      in all of the sequences.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>anr</code> &#8212;       Any Number of Repetitions
      MEME assumes each sequence may contain any
      number of non-overlapping occurrences of each
      motif. This option is useful when you suspect
      that motifs repeat multiple times within a
      single sequence. In that case, the motifs 
      found will be much more accurate than using 
      one of the other options. This option can also
      be used to discover repeats within a single
      sequence. This option takes the much more
      computer time than the first option (about ten
      times as much) and is somewhat less sensitive
      to weak motifs which do not repeat within a
      single sequence than the other two options.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SEARCH</h3>
      <ol style="list-style: upper-latin;">
        <li>
          OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
          <p>
          MEME uses an objective function on motifs to select the "best" motif.
          The objective function is based on the statistical significance of the 
          log likelihood ratio (LLR) of the occurrences of the motif.  
          The <i>E</i>-value of the motif is an estimate of the number of motifs (with the 
          same width and number of occurrences) that would have equal or higher log 
          likelihood ratio if the training set sequences had been generated randomly 
          according to the (0-order portion of the) background model. 
          </p>
          <p>
          MEME searches for the motif with the smallest <i>E</i>-value.
          It searches over different motif widths, numbers of occurrences, and
          positions in the training set for the motif occurrences.
          The user may limit the range of motif widths and number of occurrences
          that MEME tries using the switches described below.  In addition,
          MEME trims the motif (using a dynamic programming multiple alignment) to 
          eliminate any positions where there is a gap in any of the occurrences.  
          </p>
          <p>
          The log likelihood ratio of a motif is
          <code>llr = log (Pr(sites | motif) / Pr(sites | back))</code>
          and is a measure of how different the sites are from the background model.
          Pr(sites | motif) is the probability of the occurrences given the a model
          consisting of the position-specific probability matrix (PSPM) of the motif.
          (The PSPM is output by MEME).
          Pr(sites | back) is the  probability of the occurrences given the background
          model.  The background model is an n-order Markov model.  By default,
          it is a 0-order model consisting of the frequencies of the letters in
          the training set.  A different 0-order Markov model or higher order Markov 
          models can be specified to MEME using the -bfile option described below.
          </p>
          <p>
          The <i>E</i>-value reported by MEME is actually an approximation of the <i>E</i>-value
          of the log likelihood ratio.  (An approximation is used because it is far
          more efficient to compute.)  The approximation is based on the fact that
          the log likelihood ratio of a motif is the sum of the log 
          likelihood ratios of each column of the motif.  Instead of computing the 
          statistical significance of this sum (its <i>p</i>-value), MEME computes the 
          <i>p</i>-value of each column and then computes the significance of their product.  
          Although not identical to the significance of the log likelihood ratio, this 
          easier to compute objective function works very similarly in practice.
          </p>
          <p>
          The motif significance is reported as the <i>E</i>-value of the motif.  
          The statistical significance of a motif is computed based on:
          </p>
          <ol>
          <li>
          the log likelihood ratio,
          </li>
          <li>
          the width of the motif,
          </li>
          <li>
          the number of occurrences,
          </li>
          <li>
          the 0-order portion of the background model,
          </li>
          <li>
          the size of the training set, and
          </li>
          <li>
          the type of model (oops, zoops, or anr, which determines the
          number of possible different motifs of the given width and
          number of occurrences).
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          MEME searches for motifs by performing Expectation Maximization (EM) on a 
          motif model of a fixed width and using an initial estimate of the number of 
          sites.  It then sorts the possible sites according to their probability 
          according to EM.  MEME then and calculates the <i>E</i>-values of the first n sites 
          in the sorted list for different values of n.  This procedure (first EM, 
          followed by computing <i>E</i>-values for different numbers of sites) is repeated 
          with different widths and different initial estimates of the number of 
          sites.  MEME outputs the motif with the lowest <i>E</i>-value.

          The (expected) number of occurrences of each motif.
          If <code>-nsites</code> is given, only that number of occurrences
          is tried.  Otherwise, numbers of occurrences between
          <code>-minsites</code> and <code>-maxsites</code> are tried as initial guesses
          for the number of motif occurrences.  These switches are ignored if mod = oops.

          is.  It is a number in the range [0..1).  The

          <code>-maxw &lt;n&gt;</code><br/>
          <p>
          The width of the motif(s) to search for.
          If -w is given, only that width is tried.
          Otherwise, widths between -minw and -maxw are tried.

          <p>
          Note: If &lt;n&gt; is less than the length of the shortest

          <p>
          These switches control trimming (shortening) of
          motifs using the multiple alignment method.
          Specifying -nomatrim causes MEME to skip this and
          causes the other switches to be ignored.
          MEME finds the best motif
          found and then trims (shortens) it using the multiple 
          alignment method (described below). The number of 
          occurrences is then adjusted to maximize the motif 
          <i>E</i>-value, and then the motif width is further
          shortened to optimize the <i>E</i>-value.
          </p>
          <p>
          The multiple alignment method performs a separate 
          pairwise alignment of the site with the highest
          probability and each other possible site.
          (The alignment includes width/2 positions on either 
          side of the sites.) The pairwise alignment
          is controlled by the switches:
          <br />
          <code>-wg &lt;a&gt;</code> (gap cost; default: 11), <br />
          <code>-ws &lt;a&gt;</code> (space cost; default 1), and, <br />
          <code>-noendgaps</code> (do not penalize endgaps; default: 
          penalize endgaps).  <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          The pairwise alignments are then combined and the 
          method determines the widest section of the motif with 
          no insertions or deletions.  
          If this alignment is shorter than <code>&lt;minw&gt;</code>, 
          it tries to find an alignment
          allowing up to one insertion/deletion per motif
          column.  This continues (allowing up to 2, 3 ...
          insertions/deletions per motif column) until an 
          alignment of width at least <code>&lt;minw&gt;</code> is found.

             <code>-psp &lt;pspfile&gt;</code> &#8212; 
             position-specific prior (PSP)

             <p>
             These priors allow the user to bias the search for motifs. 
             They give a position-specific prior distribution on the location of motif sites
             in sequence(s) in the input dataset.  The MEME PSP format used in the pspfile
             includes the name of the sequence for which a prior distribution corresponds.
             Sequences not named in the pspfile are given uniform prior distributions on
             site locations by MEME.
             </p>
             <p>
             A PSP must be created for a specific width of motif, <code>w</code>. 
             This width must be specified for each entry in the pspfile, and must be the same
             for all entries.  If MEME varies the motif width during computation, 
             MEME renormalises the PSP for each sequence.
             </p>
             <p>
              The pspfile should be in MEME PSP format, which is similar to FASTA format.  For example:

              Each entry should start with a header line consisting of a sequence
              name followed by the width, <code>w</code>, of the PSP prior.  The sequence name must
              the name of a sequence in the FASTA file input to MEME. Any other
              text on the header line after the name and <code>w</code> is
              ignored by MEME.
              The following lines contain one number for each position in the identically-named
              named FASTA sequence, where the number gives the prior probability of a motif
              site at that position in the sequence (or in the reverse complement if
              <code>-revcomp</code> is specified).  
                The last <code>w-1</code> numbers for each entry should be
              0 (shown in blue in the example), since a motif of that width cannot start in those positions.
              All numbers for an entry must be in the range [0,1], and must sum to a number no greater
              than 1.  If they sum to less than 1 and <code>-mod oops</code> is specified,
               MEME will rescale the numbers so that they sum to 1.

          MEME averages the letter frequencies in corresponding 
          columns of the motif (PSPM) together. For instance, 
          if the width of the motif is 10, columns 1 and 10, 2 
          and 9, 3 and 8, etc., are averaged together.  The 
          averaging combines the frequency of A in one column 
          with T in the other, and the frequency of C in one 
          column with G in the other.  
          If neither option is not chosen, MEME does not 
          search for DNA palindromes.

          </li>
          <li>
          <code>-cons &lt;string&gt;</code> &#8212;  Override the sampling of starting points
              and just use a starting point derived from
              <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>.
              This is useful when an actual occurrence of
              a motif is known and can be used as the
              starting point for finding the motif.

          BRANCHING SEARCH ON EM STARTS
          <p>
          The search for good EM starting points can be improved by using branching
          search.
          </p>
          <p>
          Branching search begins with a fixed-sized heap of best EM starts identified
          during the search of subsequences from the dataset. These starts are also
          called "seeds". The fixed-sized heap of seeds is used as the "branch_heap"
          during the first iteration of branching search.
          </p>
          <p>
          For each iteration of branching search, all seeds in the current branch_heap
          are considered. All seeds in the ball within hamming distance 1 of a given
          seed are evaluated and added to a new heap. The ball of new seeds is generated
          by mutating each character of the initial seed to each alternative character
          in the alphabet.
          </p>
          <p>
          After the ball for every branch_heap seed has been evaluated, the seeds in the
          resulting new heap are added to the heap of best EM starts. The new heap is
          then used as the branch_heap for the next iteration of branching search.
          </p>
          <p>
          By default MEME does not perform x-branching.
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <code>-x_branch</code> &#8212; Perform x-branching. 
          </li>
          <li>
          <code>-bfactor &lt;bf&gt;</code> &#8212; The number of iterations of branching search. The
          default number of branching iterations is three.
          </li>
          <li>
          <code>-heapsize &lt;hs&gt;</code> &#8212; The maximum size of the heaps used during branching
              search. The default heap size is 64.

      <h2>EXAMPLES:</h2>
      <p>
      The following examples use data files provided in this release of MEME.  
      MEME writes its output to standard output, so you will want to redirect it 
      to a file in order for use with MAST.
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <p>
      A simple DNA example:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme crp0.s -dna -mod oops -pal
      </pre>
      <p>
      MEME looks for a single motif in the file <code>crp0.s</code> which contains DNA 
      sequences in FASTA format.  The OOPS model is used so MEME assumes that 
      every sequence contains exactly one occurrence of the motif.  The 
      palindrome switch is given so the motif model (PSPM) is converted into a 
      palindrome by combining corresponding frequency columns.  MEME automatically 
      chooses the best width for the motif in this example since no width was 
      specified.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      Searching for motifs on both DNA strands:
      <pre>
      meme crp0.s -dna -mod oops -revcomp
      </pre>
      <p>
      This is like the previous example except that the <code>-revcomp</code> switch tells
      MEME to consider both DNA strands, and the <code>-pal</code> switch is absent so the
      palindrome conversion is omitted.  When DNA uses both DNA strands, motif
      occurrences on the two strands may not overlap.  That is, any position
      in the sequence given in the training set may be contained in an occurrence
      of a motif on the positive strand or the negative strand, but not both.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      A fast DNA example:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme crp0.s -dna -mod oops -revcomp -w 20
      </pre>
      <p>
      This example differs from example 1) in that MEME is told to only 
      consider motifs of width 20.  This causes MEME to execute about 10 
      times faster.  The <code>-w</code> switch can also be used with protein datasets if 
      the width of the motifs is known in advance.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      Using a higher-order background model:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme INO_up800.s -dna -mod anr -revcomp -bfile yeast.nc.6.freq
      </pre>
      <p>
      In this example we use <code>-mod anr</code> and <code>-bfile yeast.nc.6.freq</code>.  
      This specifies that
      <br />
      a) the motif may have any number of occurrences in each sequence, and,
      <br />
      b) the Markov model specified in yeast.nc.6.freq is used as the 
      background model.  This file contains a fifth-order Markov model 
      for the non-coding regions in the yeast genome.
      </p>
      <p>
      Using a higher order background model can often result in more sensitive
      detection of motifs.  This is because the background model more accurately
      models non-motif sequence, allowing MEME to discriminate against it and find 
      the true motifs.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      A simple protein example:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme lipocalin.s -mod oops -maxw 20 -nmotifs 2
      </pre>
      <p>
      The <code>-dna</code> switch is absent, so MEME assumes the file 
      <code>lipocalin.s</code> contains protein sequences.  
      MEME searches for two motifs each of width less than or equal to 20.
      (Specifying <code>-maxw 20</code> makes MEME run faster since it does not have to 
      consider motifs longer than 20.) Each motif is assumed to occur in each 
      of the sequences because the OOPS model is specified.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      Another simple protein example:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme farntrans5.s -mod anr -maxw 40 -maxsites 50
      </pre>
      <p>
      MEME searches for a motif of width up to 40 with up to 50 occurrences in
      the entire training set.  The ANR sequence model is specified,
      which allows each motif to have any number of occurrences in each sequence.  
      This dataset contains motifs with multiple repeats of motifs in each 
      sequence.  This example is fairly time consuming due to the fact that the 
      time required to initial the motif probability tables is proportional 
      to <code>&lt;maxw&gt;</code> times <code>&lt;maxsites&gt;</code>.  
      By default, MEME only looks for motifs up to 
      29 letters wide with a maximum total of number of occurrences equal to twice 
      the number of sequences or 30, whichever is less.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      A much faster protein example:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme farntrans5.s -mod anr -w 10 -maxsites 30 -nmotifs 3
      </pre>
      <p>
      This time MEME is constrained to search for three motifs of width exactly ten.  
      The effect is to break up the long motif found in the previous example.  
      The <code>-w</code> switch forces motifs to be *exactly* ten letters wide.
      This example is much faster because, since only one width is considered, 
      the time to build the motif probability tables is only proportional to 
      <code>&lt;maxsites&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      Splitting the sites into three:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme farntrans5.s -mod anr -maxw 12 -nsites 24 -nmotifs 3
      </pre>
      <p>
      This forces each motif to have 24 occurrences, exactly, and be up to 12 letters wide.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      A larger protein example with <i>E</i>-value cutoff:
      </p>
      <pre>
      meme adh.s -mod zoops -nmotifs 20 -evt 0.01
      </pre>
      <p>
      In this example, MEME looks for up to 20 motifs, but stops when a motif is
      found with <i>E</i>-value greater than 0.01.  Motifs with large <i>E</i>-values are likely
      to be statistical artifacts rather than biologically significant.
