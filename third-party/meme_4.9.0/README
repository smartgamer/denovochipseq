                           Introduction             
=============================================================================
The  MEME suite provides online tools for discovering and using protein and 
DNA sequence motifs.  A motif is a pattern of nucleotides or amino acids that 
appears repeatedly in a group of related  DNA or protein sequences.  The MEME 
suite represents motifs as position-dependent scoring matrices. 

The MEME suite consists of programs which allow you to: 
  meme      - for discovery of motifs shared by a group of sequences, 
  mast      - for search of databases for sequences containing these motifs,
  tomtom    - for searching databases of motifs for similar motifs,
  gomo      - for finding Gene Ontology terms linked to the motifs,
  glam2     - for discovery of gapped motifs,
  glam2scan - for scanning sequences with gapped motifs,
  fimo      - for scanning sequences with motifs,
  mcast     - for finding motif clusters,
  meme-chip - for analysis of large DNA datasets like ChIPseq output,
  spamo     - for finding motif complexes by analysing motif spacing,
  dreme     - for discovery of short regular expression motifs,
and that's just the web enabled tools.

You can download the C source code for MEME suite from

=============================================================================
Detailed notes are given in the MEME wiki: 
  https://nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MEME_Developers%27_Guide

1. Clone from bitbucket (you have to be granted access to this mercurial repository):
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/tlbailey/meme

2. To create a distribution tar ball meme_VERSION.tar.gz.  (Note: the
        version number is set in configure.ac using variable
        AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.)
    cd trunk
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --enable-web --enable-opt --enable-build-libxml2 --enable-build-libxslt
    make dist
