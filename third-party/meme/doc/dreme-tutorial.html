    <h1>DREME Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>DREME is a tool for discovering short regular expression motifs which
    are enriched in the provided dataset. It is limited to working in DNA
    as the large combination space for amino acids makes DREME's approach
    unfeasable. DREME also has the capability to use two datasets to
    find motifs which are enriched in one when compared to the other.
    <h2>How DREME works</h2>
    <p>Note the following referrs to the sequence set in which you are finding
    motifs in as the positive sequences and to the comparative sequence
    set as the negative sequences.
    <ol>
      <li>If there are no negative sequences provided then di-nucleotide 
      shuffle the postive sequences to create one.</li>
      <li>Count the number of positive sequences and the number of negative
      sequences.</li>
      <li>Find all unique subsequences with no ambiguity characters which 
      have a length in the range given (3 to 8 nucleotides by default) 
      in the positive sequences.</li>
      <li>For each of the subsequences 
      <ol>
        <li>Count the number of sequences it occurs in for the positive and 
        negative sequences.</li>
        <li>Use Fisher's exact test to determine the significance.</li>
        <li>Add the subsequence to a sorted (by p-value) set of regular 
        expression motifs.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Repeatedly pick the top motifs (default 100) to generalise 
      by replacing one position with each possible ambiguity code and 
      estimating the resultant p-value. This is done enough times to allow
      each position to have an ambiguity code.</li>
      <li>For each of the top (default 100) generalized RE motifs
      <ol>
        <li>Count the number of sequences matched in the positive and negative 
        sequences.</li>
        <li>Use Fisher's exact test to determine the significance.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Pick the best RE motif and (assuming it meets the E-value threshold) 
      scan for all matching sites to build up a frequency matrix and report 
      it.</li>
      <li>Mask the matched sites with the wildcard character 'N'.</li>
      <li>If the limits have not been met then loop back to step 3 to find 
      more motifs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sequence set</h2>
    <p>DREME works best with lots of short (~ 100bp) sequences. If you have a
    couple of long sequences then it might be benificial to split them into
    many smaller (~ 100bp) sequences. With ChIP-seq data we recommend using
    100bp regions around the peaks.</p>
    <h2>Comparative sequence set</h2>
    <p>DREME always uses a comparative sequence set but you don't have to supply
    it as DREME can create it by using di-nucleotide shuffling. If you wish 
    to use your own sequence set then there are a few guidlines you should 
    follow.</p>

    <p>The sequence lengths of the comparative sequences should be roughly
    the same as the sequences to search for motifs. This is because the null
    model assumes that the probability of finding a match in a sequence in 
    either sequence set will be roughly the same for an uninteresing motif. 
    If the comparative sequences are longer this provides more 
    locations that the motif could match making it more likely it will match 
    and hence skewing the p-value calculations possibly excluding a motif 
    you would be interested in.</p>
