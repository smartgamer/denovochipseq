<h1>GLAM2 Dirichlet Mixtures</h1>

<h2>Dirichlet mixture files</h2>

<p>A Dirichlet mixture file specifies residues' tendencies to align
with one another, and is the basis for scoring columns of aligned
residues. The format is identical to that of <a
	href="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/dirichlets/">UCSC
Dirichlet mixtures</a>. For examples, see recode3.20comp (copied from UCSC)
and glam_tfbs.1comp in the GLAM2 examples directory.</p>

<p>The GLAM2 programs only read lines beginning with Mixture= or
Alpha=. Mixture= is followed by a number giving the weight of that
mixture component: these weights should sum to 1. Alpha= is followed by
a list of numbers giving the pseudocounts for that mixture component, as
many as there are symbols in the alphabet. The first number after Alpha=
is the sum of the pseudocounts, and is in fact ignored by the GLAM2
programs.</p>

<p>The pseudocounts should be in the same order as the alphabet
symbols. For the n (nucleotide) alphabet, this is: acgt. For the p
(protein) alphabet, this is: ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY.</p>

<h2>Built-in Dirichlet mixtures</h2>

<p>If no Dirichlet mixture file is specified, the default is to use
recode3.20comp for the p (protein) alphabet, glam_tfbs.1comp for the n
(nucleotide) alphabet, and a uniform prior for user-specified alphabets.</p>
