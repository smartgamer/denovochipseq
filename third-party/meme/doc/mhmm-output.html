      <h1>MHMM Output</h1>
      <p><b>The Meta-MEME model file contains the following
      information:</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Meta-MEME version number and release date.</li>
      <li>The program name, file contents and date the file was
      created.</li>
      <li>A link to the Meta-MEME home page.</li>
      <li>A reference to cite if you publish results from Meta-MEME.</li>
      <li>Some global information about the Meta-MEME model.</li>
      <li>A list of the states in the Meta-MEME model.</li>
      <li>The matrix of transition probabilities between states of the
      model.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p><b>HMM Global Information</b></p>
      The list of states in the Meta-MEME model begins with eight lines
      that specify the global characteristics of the model. These lines
      tell<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
      <li>whether the model has a linear or completely connected topology
      (i.e., whether the model allows for repetition and shuffling of
      motifs),</li>
      <li>the total number of states in the model,</li>
      <li>the total number of spacers (i.e., inter-motif regions) in the
      model,</li>
      <li>the number of states used to represent each spacer,</li>
      <li>the number of letters in the alphabet (4 for DNA and 20 for
      amino acids),</li>
      <li>the alphabet,</li>
      <li>the background frequencies used as emission probabilities in
      the spacer states, and</li>
      <li>the name of the MEME output file that was used to generate this
      Meta-MEME model.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p><b>HMM States</b></p>
      <p>Following the global characteristics is a list of state
      descriptions. Each state description consists of six lines. These
      lines tell</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the index of the state (numbered from 0),</li>
      <li>the type of state (i.e, whether it is a start or end state, a
      spacer state, or the beginning, middle or end of a motif),</li>
      <li>the index of the motif within which this state appears (This
      value is arbitrarily set to -1 for non-motif states.),</li>
      <li>the position of the state within the motif or spacer region,
      and</li>
      <li>the letter that is printed above this state when the MEME motif
      ID is printed centered with respect to the motif,</li>
      <li>the list of probabilities that this state will emit each of the
      letters in the alphabet.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>The final item (the list of emission probabilities) is omitted
      from the start and end states, which do not emit letters.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p><b>Transition probability matrix</b></p>
      <p>The Meta-MEME model file ends with a square matrix containing n
      rows and n columns, where n is the number of states in the model.
      The entry in row i, column j of this matrix is the probability of
      transitioning from state i to state j in the model. Consequently,
      each row in the matrix sums to 1.0.</p>
