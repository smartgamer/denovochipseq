      <h3>Usage:</h3> 
      <code>meme-chip [options] [-db &lt;motif database&gt;]+ &lt;sequences&gt;</code>
    </div>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>MEME-ChIP performs several motif analysis steps on a set of DNA
      sequences that you provide. It is especially appropriate for analyzing
      the bound genomic regions identified in a transcription factor (TF)
      ChIP-seq experiment.</p> 
      
      <p>MEME-ChIP can</p>
      <ol>
        <li>discover novel DNA-binding motifs (with MEME and DREME),</li> 
        <li>determine which motifs are most centrally enriched (with CentriMo),</li> 
        <li>analyze them for similarity to known binding motifs (with Tomtom), and</li> 
        <li>automatically group the found motifs by similarity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It is worth noting that MEME-ChIP is <b>not</b> a motif scanner, but
      the motifs discovered by it can be used by FIMO or MAST to scan
      for motif sites.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Input</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>A set of sequences in FASTA format. Ideally the sequences should be all
      the same length, between 100 and 500 base-pairs long and centrally
      enriched for motifs. The immediate regions around individual ChIP-seq 
      "peaks" from a transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq experiment are ideal.
      The suggested 100 base-pair minimum size is based on the typical 
      resolution of ChIP-seq peaks but it is useful to have more of the
      surrounding sequence to give CentriMo the power to tell if a motif is
      centrally enriched. We recommend that you "repeat mask" your
      sequences, replacing repeat regions to the "N" character.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>MEME ChIP runs each program in its analysis in a different folder 
      in the output directory. A summary file (index.html) is created in 
      the output directory which lists the top motifs found and links to the
      results for each program.</p>
